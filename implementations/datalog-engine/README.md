# Datalog Deductive Database Engine

## Overview

This implementation provides a high-performance Datalog deductive database engine optimized for large-scale knowledge representation and reasoning. Datalog combines the declarative nature of logic programming with the scalability of relational databases, making it ideal for complex knowledge graph queries and deductive reasoning tasks.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Fact Database**: Efficient storage for ground facts (extensional database - EDB)
2. **Rule Engine**: Processing and evaluation of Datalog rules (intensional database - IDB)
3. **Query Processor**: Efficient query evaluation using bottom-up and top-down strategies
4. **Fixpoint Engine**: Iterative computation for recursive rules
5. **Optimization Engine**: Query and rule optimization for performance
6. **Indexing System**: Multi-dimensional indexing for fast fact retrieval

## Key Features

- **Pure Datalog**: Safe, function-free Datalog with negation
- **Stratified Negation**: Support for negation in stratified programs
- **Recursive Rules**: Efficient handling of recursive definitions
- **Bottom-up Evaluation**: Semi-naive evaluation for fixpoint computation
- **Top-down Evaluation**: Magic sets transformation for goal-oriented queries
- **Incremental Maintenance**: Efficient updates with incremental view maintenance
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded rule evaluation and query processing

## Datalog Syntax and Semantics

### Basic Facts
```datalog
% Facts (ground atoms)
person(john).
person(mary).
person(bob).

company(google).
company(microsoft).

works_at(john, google).
works_at(mary, microsoft).
works_at(bob, google).

expertise(john, ai).
expertise(mary, databases).
expertise(bob, systems).
```

### Rules (Horn Clauses)
```datalog
% Simple rules
employee(X) :- works_at(X, _).
employer(Y) :- works_at(_, Y).

% Rules with multiple conditions
colleague(X, Y) :- 
    works_at(X, Z), 
    works_at(Y, Z), 
    X != Y.

% Recursive rules
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), ancestor(Y, Z).

% Rules with negation (stratified)
senior_employee(X) :- 
    employee(X), 
    expertise(X, Field),
    not junior_in_field(X, Field).

junior_in_field(X, Field) :- 
    employee(X), 
    expertise(X, Field),
    years_experience(X, Years),
    Years < 5.
```

### Complex Knowledge Patterns
```datalog
% Transitive closure
reaches(X, Y) :- connected(X, Y).
reaches(X, Z) :- connected(X, Y), reaches(Y, Z).

% Path finding with constraints
path(X, Y, 1) :- connected(X, Y).
path(X, Z, N) :- 
    connected(X, Y), 
    path(Y, Z, M), 
    N = M + 1,
    N <= 10.  % Maximum path length

% Aggregation (counting)
team_size(Company, Count) :- 
    company(Company),
    Count = count(X : works_at(X, Company)).

% Complex joins and projections
expert_teams(Company, Field, Team) :-
    company(Company),
    expertise(Field),
    Team = {X : works_at(X, Company), expertise(X, Field)}.
```

## Evaluation Strategies

### Bottom-Up Evaluation (Forward Chaining)
```python
# Semi-naive algorithm for recursive rules
def semi_naive_evaluation(rules, facts):
    """
    Efficiently compute fixpoint using semi-naive evaluation
    - Only considers newly derived facts in each iteration
    - Avoids redundant computation of previously derived facts
    - Guaranteed to terminate for safe Datalog programs
    """
    derived = set(facts)
    new_facts = set(facts)
    
    while new_facts:
        iteration_facts = set()
        
        for rule in rules:
            # Apply rule using new_facts for at least one atom
            rule_results = apply_rule_semi_naive(rule, derived, new_facts)
            iteration_facts.update(rule_results)
        
        # Remove already derived facts
        new_facts = iteration_facts - derived
        derived.update(new_facts)
    
    return derived
```

### Top-Down Evaluation (Backward Chaining)
```python
# Magic sets transformation for goal-oriented evaluation
def magic_sets_transformation(rules, query):
    """
    Transform Datalog program for efficient top-down evaluation
    - Creates "magic" predicates to propagate query constraints
    - Reduces search space by filtering irrelevant facts
    - Combines benefits of top-down and bottom-up approaches
    """
    magic_rules = []
    transformed_rules = []
    
    # Create magic predicates for query goals
    for goal in query.goals:
        magic_predicate = create_magic_predicate(goal)
        magic_rules.append(magic_predicate)
    
    # Transform original rules to use magic predicates
    for rule in rules:
        transformed_rule = add_magic_conditions(rule, magic_rules)
        transformed_rules.append(transformed_rule)
    
    return magic_rules + transformed_rules
```

## Performance Characteristics

## Query Examples

### Basic Queries
```datalog
% Find all employees
?- employee(X).

% Find colleagues of John
?- colleague(john, X).

% Find all companies with AI experts
?- works_at(X, Company), expertise(X, ai).
```

### Complex Analytical Queries
```datalog
% Find shortest path between nodes
shortest_path(X, Y, Distance) :-
    path(X, Y, Distance),
    not (path(X, Y, D), D < Distance).

% Find strongly connected components
in_same_scc(X, Y) :-
    reaches(X, Y),
    reaches(Y, X).

scc_representative(X, Representative) :-
    in_same_scc(X, Representative),
    not (in_same_scc(X, Y), Y < Representative).

% Complex aggregation and analysis
collaboration_strength(X, Y, Strength) :-
    person(X), person(Y), X != Y,
    Strength = count(Project : worked_on(X, Project), worked_on(Y, Project)).

top_collaborators(X, TopCollabs) :-
    person(X),
    TopCollabs = top(5, Y, S : collaboration_strength(X, Y, S)).
```

### Temporal and Dynamic Queries
```datalog
% Temporal facts with time intervals
works_at(john, google, 2020, 2023).
works_at(john, microsoft, 2023, 2025).

% Temporal rules
employed_during(X, Company, Year) :-
    works_at(X, Company, Start, End),
    Start <= Year,
    Year <= End.

% Career progression analysis
career_progression(X, Path) :-
    person(X),
    Path = sequence(Company, Year : employed_during(X, Company, Year)).
```

## Advanced Features

### Stratified Negation
```datalog
% Stratification ensures correct semantics for negation
% Stratum 0: Base facts
person(john). person(mary).
likes(john, mary).

% Stratum 1: Positive rules
friend(X, Y) :- likes(X, Y), likes(Y, X).

% Stratum 2: Rules with negation (higher stratum)
not_friend(X, Y) :- 
    person(X), person(Y), 
    not friend(X, Y),
    X != Y.
```

### Incremental Maintenance
```python
class IncrementalDatalog:
    """
    Incremental maintenance for dynamic fact updates
    """
    
    def insert_fact(self, fact):
        """Insert new fact and incrementally update derived facts"""
        if fact not in self.facts:
            self.facts.add(fact)
            # Incrementally derive new consequences
            new_derivations = self.derive_incremental(fact)
            self.derived_facts.update(new_derivations)
    
    def delete_fact(self, fact):
        """Delete fact and incrementally maintain consistency"""
        if fact in self.facts:
            self.facts.remove(fact)
            # Find and remove dependent derivations
            affected = self.find_dependent_facts(fact)
            self.rederive_affected(affected)
```

### Optimization Techniques

#### Rule Reordering
```datalog
% Original rule (potentially inefficient)
expensive_query(X, Y) :-
    large_table1(X, Z),  % 1M facts
    large_table2(Z, Y),  % 1M facts
    small_filter(Y).     % 1K facts

% Optimized rule (filter first)
expensive_query(X, Y) :-
    small_filter(Y),     % Apply selective condition first
    large_table2(Z, Y),  % Reduced intermediate results
    large_table1(X, Z).  % Final join
```

#### Index Selection
```python
# Automatic index creation based on query patterns
class DatalogOptimizer:
    def analyze_query_patterns(self, rules, queries):
        """Analyze access patterns to create optimal indexes"""
        access_patterns = {}
        
        for rule in rules:
            for atom in rule.body:
                pattern = self.extract_access_pattern(atom)
                access_patterns[pattern] = access_patterns.get(pattern, 0) + 1
        
        # Create indexes for frequent access patterns
        return self.create_optimal_indexes(access_patterns)
```

## Use Cases

1. **Knowledge Graph Reasoning**: Complex relationship inference
2. **Business Rules**: Policy and compliance rule evaluation
3. **Graph Analytics**: Path finding, reachability, centrality
4. **Data Integration**: Schema mapping and data fusion
5. **Security Analysis**: Access control and vulnerability detection
6. **Scientific Computing**: Logical modeling and simulation
7. **Recommendation Systems**: Collaborative filtering with logic

## Integration Examples

### Python API
```python
from datalog_engine import DatalogEngine

# Create engine
engine = DatalogEngine()

# Add facts
engine.add_facts([
    "person(john)",
    "person(mary)", 
    "works_at(john, google)",
    "works_at(mary, microsoft)"
])

# Add rules
engine.add_rules([
    "employee(X) :- works_at(X, _)",
    "colleague(X, Y) :- works_at(X, Z), works_at(Y, Z), X != Y"
])

# Execute queries
results = engine.query("colleague(X, Y)")
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['X']} and {result['Y']} are colleagues")
```

### SQL Integration
```sql
-- Export Datalog results to SQL tables
CREATE TABLE datalog_results AS
SELECT DISTINCT X as person1, Y as person2
FROM datalog_query('colleague(X, Y)');

-- Use in complex SQL analytics
SELECT person1, COUNT(*) as colleague_count
FROM datalog_results
GROUP BY person1
ORDER BY colleague_count DESC;
```
