# Prolog-Based Knowledge Representation System

## Overview

This implementation provides a sophisticated Prolog-based knowledge base that leverages logic programming principles for knowledge representation, inference, and reasoning. It demonstrates how Prolog's declarative nature and built-in inference engine naturally align with knowledge graph concepts.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Knowledge Base (KB) Core**: Facts and rules representing domain knowledge
2. **Inference Engine**: Built-in Prolog resolution and unification
3. **Context Management**: Support for multiple knowledge contexts
4. **Reification Support**: Representing relationships as first-class objects
5. **Temporal Reasoning**: Time-aware knowledge representation
6. **Uncertainty Handling**: Probabilistic reasoning extensions

## Key Features

- **Declarative Knowledge**: Facts and rules stored as Prolog predicates
- **Dynamic Inference**: Real-time reasoning and query resolution
- **Context-Dependent Definitions**: Polymorphic predicates with different arity
- **Reified Relationships**: Edges as first-class objects with properties
- **Temporal Support**: Time-stamped facts and temporal queries
- **Meta-Reasoning**: Reasoning about reasoning (meta-predicates)
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Probabilistic facts and fuzzy logic

## Knowledge Representation Examples

### Basic Facts and Rules
```prolog
% Entity types and properties
entity(john, person).
entity(google, company).
entity(ai, field).

% Basic relationships
works_at(john, google).
has_expertise(john, ai).
develops(google, ai_products).

% Rules for inference
expert_at_company(Person, Field, Company) :-
    works_at(Person, Company),
    has_expertise(Person, Field),
    develops(Company, products_in(Field)).
```

### Reified Relationships
```prolog
% Relationship as first-class object
relationship(rel_001, works_at, john, google, [
    start_date(2022-01-01),
    role(senior_engineer),
    confidence(0.95)
]).

% Meta-relationships
contradicts(rel_001, rel_002, evidence(conflicting_records)).
supports(rel_003, rel_001, evidence(hr_records)).
```

### Temporal Knowledge
```prolog
% Time-stamped facts
fact_at_time(works_at(john, google), 2022-01-01, 2024-12-31).
fact_at_time(has_expertise(john, machine_learning), 2020-01-01, current).

% Temporal queries
worked_together_during(Person1, Person2, Company, StartTime, EndTime) :-
    fact_at_time(works_at(Person1, Company), Start1, End1),
    fact_at_time(works_at(Person2, Company), Start2, End2),
    time_overlap(Start1-End1, Start2-End2, StartTime-EndTime).
```

## Implementation Files

- `kb_core.pl`: Core knowledge base predicates and inference rules
- `reification.pl`: Support for reified relationships and meta-relationships
- `temporal.pl`: Temporal reasoning and time-aware queries
- `uncertainty.pl`: Probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty handling
- `context.pl`: Multiple context management
- `queries.pl`: Common query patterns and examples
- `utils.pl`: Utility predicates and helper functions

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Usage**: Efficient for medium-scale knowledge bases (100K-1M facts)
- **Query Speed**: Excellent for complex logical queries and inference
- **Reasoning**: Native support for deductive reasoning and rule application
- **Scalability**: Best suited for knowledge-intensive rather than data-intensive applications

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries
```prolog
?- works_at(john, Company).
Company = google.

?- expert_at_company(Person, ai, google).
Person = john.
```

### Complex Pattern Matching
```prolog
?- collaboration_pattern(Person1, Person2, Project, Skills).
Person1 = alice,
Person2 = bob,
Project = ai_research,
Skills = [machine_learning, natural_language].
```

### Temporal Queries
```prolog
?- worked_together_during(alice, bob, google, Start, End).
Start = 2022-06-01,
End = 2023-12-31.
```

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Neo4j Bridge**: Export/import functionality for Neo4j graphs
- **RDF Integration**: Convert between Prolog facts and RDF triples
- **Python Interface**: PySwip integration for hybrid systems
- **REST API**: HTTP interface for external system integration

## Advantages

1. **Natural Logic**: Direct representation of logical relationships
2. **Built-in Inference**: No need for separate reasoning engine
3. **Flexible Queries**: Powerful pattern matching and unification
4. **Declarative**: What you know vs. how to compute it
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new rules and facts
6. **Meta-Programming**: Reason about the reasoning process itself

## Use Cases

- Expert systems and decision support
- Semantic reasoning and inference
- Complex relationship modeling
- Rule-based knowledge representation
- Academic and research applications
- Ontology reasoning and validation

## Getting Started

1. Install SWI-Prolog
2. Load the knowledge base: `?- [kb_core].`
3. Query the system: `?- your_query_here.`
4. Add new facts and rules as needed
